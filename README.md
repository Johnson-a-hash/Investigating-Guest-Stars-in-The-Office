# Investigating-Guest-Stars-in-The-Office
Apply the foundational skills in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python courses to manipulate and visualize movie and TV data.

In these project, Iâ€™ll apply the skills I have learnt in the Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem.
The Office is an American Mockumentary sitcom television series that depicts the
everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional
Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.
In this project, I will take a look at a dataset of The Office episodes, and try to
understand how the popularity and quality of the series varied over time. To do so, I
will use the following dataset: datasets/office_episodes.csv, which was downloaded
from Kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/nehaprabhavalkar/the-office-dataset?select=the_office_series.csv
